## Main Idea 

Geared towards anyone dealing with mental issues including but not limited to suicidal tendencies, mental disorders such as BPD or Schizophrenia or MPD. Idea is to make it easier for the person dealing with such issues to talk to anyone who doesn't neccesarily have to be a licensed therapist or a mental health professional but rather anyone who is willing to lend a helping ear to talk to or vent it out. More of a peer-peer support and making it more accessible. Bridging the gap between going to a clinical therapist and not being vocal about it at all so as to atleast help nudge someone dealing with these issues in the right direction.
